# üõí Sentiment-Based Product Recommendation System

This project focuses on building a sentiment-aware product recommendation engine using machine learning and collaborative filtering techniques. It is structured into multiple components that cover data preprocessing, sentiment classification, recommendation generation, and deployment through a web interface.

## üîç Workflow Breakdown

### 1. **Understanding the Data**
The project begins with a thorough exploration of the dataset, including a review of all attributes and structure. All relevant documentation and schema are available in the dataset folder for reference.

### 2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Before model building, the data undergoes necessary cleansing and transformation steps:
- Text data (`review_title` and `review_text`) is combined.
- NLP techniques such as tokenization and stopword removal are applied.
- The TF-IDF method is used to vectorize the text, capturing the importance of terms across the corpus.

### 3. **Handling Class Imbalance**
To tackle imbalanced sentiment classes (positive vs. negative), the SMOTE technique is implemented, generating synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the dataset.

### 4. **Sentiment Classification Models**
Several classification algorithms are trained to categorize user sentiment (1 = positive, 0 = negative):
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

Models are evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC. Among all, **XGBoost** is identified as the most effective based on its performance across metrics.

### 5. **Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering**
To generate personalized product suggestions, both **User-User** and **Item-Item** collaborative filtering methods are implemented. Model effectiveness is validated using **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error).

### 6. **Product Sentiment Aggregation**
Top 20 products are shortlisted using the recommender output. For each, user sentiment is predicted across all associated reviews. The top 5 products with the highest proportion of positive feedback are selected for final recommendations.

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

- **Model Serialization**: Trained models are saved as `.pkl` files under the `/pickle` directory for easy reuse and deployment.
- **API Development**: A lightweight Flask API (`app.py`) enables testing and interaction with the models.
- **Frontend Interface**: A simple, responsive user interface is built using Bootstrap and Jinja templates (`templates/index.html`). The UI is kept minimal without any custom styling.
